#### A Proposal to Adjust the Allocation Plan of B1 Account Tokens

#### Proposer: Awake


EOSC mainnet was launched on June 22, 2018 (UTC+8), allocating 10% of the block rewards to B1 accounts. On July 18, 2019, EOSFORCE Mainnet Improvement Proposal FIP#7 was adopted at the 11th BP Meeting. The FIP#7 proposal redistributed the inflation rate of the mainnet and all EOSC tokens. To ensure the long-term independent development of the mainnet, improve the effectiveness of the reward mechanism, and clarify the token distribution and community expectations, this proposal proposes as follows:



1.The B1 account token allocation is adjusted from the fixed block rewards to the application from the decentralized budget system according to the contribution.

2.The allocated tokens of B1 accounts are unaffected.
