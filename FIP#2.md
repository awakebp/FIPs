## EOSC Mainnet Voting Reward Proposal


**1. The nodes whose votes obtained are more than 0.5% of the total votes of current network are profitable nodes. Among these profitable nodes, there are BPs and BP candidates. The first 23 are BPs and the rest are BP candidates.**


**2. All profitable nodes can obtain the income, which is allocated according to the voting weight. (Voting weight=total votes of profitable nodes/total votes in the current network)**

**> Remarks:**

   - The income is allocated to profitable nodes each time a block is generated.
   
   - Each profitable node gains the income according to the voting weight, which is the proportion of the votes it receives to the total votes in the current network.
   - 70% of the node's income will go into its rewards pool. The allocation proportion is freely set by the node.
   
   - For the BPs, 15% of the income will be credited to its account as basic salary, and 15% of the income will be credited to its account as block-generating reward.
   
   - For the BP candidates, 15% of the income will be credited to its account as basic salary, and 15% of the income will be credited to EOSC Network Foundation account Devfund.
  
   - The part of less than 0.0001 EOSC is discarded in every single income. In particular, if the total amout a single income is less than 0.0001 EOSC, it will not be issued. Each time the block reward is calculated, if the sum of this part is greater than 0.0001 EOSC, it is credited to EOSC Network Foundation account Devfund. Note: Voters will obtain rewards by voting for profitable nodes. If vote for non-profitable nodes, no reward will be obtained.
