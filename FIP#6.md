## Non-Delay Vote Token Redemption Proposal Voting

### Proposer：Eosmainbp

To improve community governance efficiency and to attract more network BPs to community governance, it is proposed: 

The votes in the vote pool in mainnet voting will have no time delay when switched to vote for other BP nodes

Redemption from the vote pool will still have the 3-day delay when redeemed for balance.

> Notes:

> Voting age will start from 0 when vote is cast for another candidate. The proposal aims to increase inter-BP competition and voter participation, as well as encouraging new BPs entering the competition.
