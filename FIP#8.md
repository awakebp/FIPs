## A Proposal to Adjust The Upper Limit of EOSC Mainnet Contract Deployment

### Proposer: Jiqix

EOSC mainnet currently requires the contract employment size to be less than 200KB, or the deployment fails. To support complex contract deployments, this proposal proposes to adjust the upper limit to 1M to support more contracts.
